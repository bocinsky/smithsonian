This repository provides geospatial data for the Smithsonian Trinomial system of unique identifiers assigned to archaeological sites in the United States, as well as for systems used by certain states in the US.

The Smithsonian Trinomial system was created by the Smithsonian Institution in the 1940s as a systematic way to catalog archaeological sites in the US.
