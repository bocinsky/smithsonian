Geospatial data including the three-letter quad designations are available at https://mrdata.usgs.gov/ak/quadrangles/."
Arizona,2,AZ {quad}:n (suffix),https://azsite3.asurite.ad.asu.edu/azsite/links/site_numb_system.pdf,"Arizona uses the Arizona State Museum (ASM) Site Numbering and Quadrangle System, which is a five-part designation including the state (AZ), a sequential letter representing the quadrangle (AÐFF), a number representing the quadrangle subdivision (1Ð16), a unique sequential number within that quadrangle subdivision, and a suffix denoting the site numbering authority (e.g., ""ASM"").

Some sites that were recorded prior to the adoption of this system still have Smithsonian Trinomial designations. Questions should be directed to the Connecticut Office of State Archaeology."
Delaware,7,{state_code}{county_code}-[block]-nnn,https://history.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/179/2019/01/Data-Coordination-and-Forms-2015.pdf,"Delaware uses a modified Smithsonian Trinomial site numbering system for archaeological sites; in addition to state and county codes, counties are subdivided into ""blocks"" (designated AÐK), within which sites are assigned sequential numbers with leading zeros. Historical properties use a slightly different numbering system. Delaware counties have single-letter designations. The Delaware State Historic Preservation Office was not willing to provide a geospatial file of the blocks for public use; questions should be directed to the DE SHPO."
